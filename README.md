# banking-project

ABOUT DATASET: There has been a revenue decline in the Portuguese Bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, they found that the root cause was that their customers are not investing enough for long term deposits. So the bank would like to identify existing customers that have a higher chance to subscribe for a long term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such customers.

# PROJECT FILES EXPLAINED
- notebook(1).ipynb: Jupyter nootebook for EDA, data cleaning and preprocessing, feature Engineering and training our models.
- model.bin: contains our saved model

# ProjectWorkflow
- The Banking dataset was gotten from kaggle link:
- Importing necessary libriaries then proceed to perform ata cleaning, Feature engineering and EDA for better ungerstanding of our dataset
- Carried out data splitting and One Hot Encoding on our categorical values
- different algorithms were used to train our model (Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Xgboost) performed hyper paremeter tuning and saved our model as a bin file

Do check it out: more work that can be done deploying our model into the web
